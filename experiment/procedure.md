### To start the experiment do the following:

  

  (A)  Preparation of Lassaigne’s Extract (Sodium Fusion Extract) 

  

(i)Heat a small piece of dry sodium metal in a fusion tube until it melts. 

 

(ii)Add a small amount of the organic compound and heat strongly for 2-3 min until fusion tube gets red hot. 

 

(iii)Dip the hot fusion tube into distilled water in a porcelain dish. 



(iv)Break the fusion tube, And. 

 

(v)Boil the mixture for 5-8 min ,then cool mixture at room temperature and filter. The filtrate is the Sodium Fusion Extract also known as Lassaigne’s Extract (L.E.). 

  

1. Test for Nitrogen 

  

(i)Add 2 ml of freshly prepared sodium extract, add FeSO₄ solution and heat for 2-5 min. 

 

(ii)Add NaOH to make it alkaline. 

 

(iii)Cool at room temperature and acidify with dilute H₂SO₄. 

  

 Observation:  

 

Formation of Prussian blue colour confirms nitrogen. 

  

2. Test for Sulphur 

  

(a) Lead Acetate Test:  

(i)Add lead acetate solution to 2 mL of freshly prepared sodium extract and heat. 

  

Observation:  

 

Formation of black ppt (PbS) indicates sulphur.  

  

3. Test for Halogens 

  

(i)Boil 2 mL of freshly prepared sodium extract with dilute HNO₃ to remove interfering ions (like CN⁻, S²⁻). 

 

(ii)Cool at room temperature and add 2-5 ml of AgNO₃ solution.  

  

Observation: 

  

White ppt (soluble in NH₄OH) → Chlorine 

 

 Pale yellow ppt (partly soluble) → Bromine 

 

 Yellow ppt (insoluble) → Iodine
