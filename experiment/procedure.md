**1. Preparation of Lassaigne’s Extract (Sodium Fusion Extract)**
     

a. Heat a small piece of dry sodium metal in a fusion tube until it melts.


b. Add a small amount of the organic compound and heat strongly until  fusion tube gets red hot.


c. Dip the hot tube into distilled water in a porcelain dish.


d. Now smash the tube into a  porcelain dish.


d. Boil the mixture atleast 5-8 min, then cool it at room temperature, and filter it. The filtrate is the Sodium Fusion Extract which is also known as Lassaigne’s Extract (L.E.).



 **2. Test for Nitrogen**

a. Take 2 mL of freshly prepared Sodium fusion extract , add FeSO₄ solution and heat for 2-4 min.

b. Add NaOH to make it alkaline.

c. Cool it at room temperature and acidify with dilute H₂SO₄.


*Observation*:</br> 
Formation of Prussian blue color confirms nitrogen.



**3. Test for Sulphur**
    
a. Add acetic acid to 2 mL of freshly prepared Sodium fusion extract and heat for 2-4 min.
b. Add Lead Acetate to prepared soln.


*Observation*:</br>
Formation of black ppt (PbS) indicates sulfur.



**4. Test for Halogens**

a. Boil 2 mL of freshly prepared Sodium fusion extract with dilute HNO₃ to remove interfering ions (like CN⁻, S²⁻).


b. Cool it at room temperature and add AgNO₃ solution.



*Observation*:

White ppt (soluble in NH₄OH) → Chlorine

Pale yellow ppt (partly soluble) → Bromine

Yellow ppt (insoluble) → Iodine
