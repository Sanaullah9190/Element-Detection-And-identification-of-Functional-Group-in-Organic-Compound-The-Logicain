### To start the experiment do the following:

  

  (A)  Preparation of Lassaigne’s Extract (Sodium Fusion Extract) 

  

Heat a small piece of dry sodium metal in a fusion tube until it melts. 

 

Add a small amount of the organic compound and heat strongly until red hot. 

 

Plunge the hot tube into distilled water in a porcelain dish. 

 

Boil the mixture, cool, and filter. The filtrate is the Lassaigne’s extract (L.E.). 

  

1. Test for Nitrogen 

  

To 2 mL of L.E., add FeSO₄ solution and heat. 

 

Add NaOH to make it alkaline. 

 

Cool and acidify with dilute H₂SO₄. 

  

 Observation:  

 

Formation of Prussian blue colour confirms nitrogen. 

  

2. Test for Sulphur 

  

(a) Lead Acetate Test:  

Add lead acetate solution to 2 mL of L.E. and heat. 

  

Observation:  

 

Formation of black ppt (PbS) indicates sulphur.  

  

3. Test for Halogens 

  

Boil 2 mL of L.E. with dilute HNO₃ to remove interfering ions (like CN⁻, S²⁻). 

 

Cool and add AgNO₃ solution.  

  

Observation: 

  

White ppt (soluble in NH₄OH) → Chlorine 

 

 Pale yellow ppt (partly soluble) → Bromine 

 

 Yellow ppt (insoluble) → Iodine
