### 
Carbon is the main constituent element of all organic compounds. Hydrogen is also present in most of the organic compounds, but there are few exceptions, such as: CCl4, CS2 , etc. Elements other than these elements such as nitrogen, sulphur and halogens (chlorine, bromine and iodine) may also be present in organic compounds. These extra elements are usually detected by Lassaigne's Test that was developed by the French Chemist J.L Lassaigne. In this test, the organic compound is fused with metallic sodium to convert these elements into water soluble sodium salt. Usual qualitative tests are performed on this extract for the detection of respective elements.

**Detection of Nitrogen**
If nitrogen is present in the compound, the Lassaigne's extract would contain sodium cyanide formed during fusion. Sodium cyanide is converted to sodium ferrocyanide on treating with ferrous sulphate. On further treating it with ferric chloride, a prussian blue complex, ferricferrocyanide is formed.</br>
   Na + C + N → NaCN</br>
   FeSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaOH → Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></br>
   Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2NaCN → Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 2NaOH </br>
   Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 4NaCN → Na<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub> </br>
   3Na<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] + 4FeCl<sub>3</sub> → Fe<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub> + 12NaCl </br>

**Detection of Sulphur**
Sodium sulphide formed during the preparation of Lassaigne's extract reacts with lead acetate to yield lead sulphide as black precipitate.</br>
Na<sub>2</sub>S + (CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Pb → PbS + 2CH<sub>3</sub>COONa

**Detection of Halogens** </br>
**(a) Chlorine**
During the preparation of Lassaigne's extract, chlorine form the organic compound reacts with sodium to form sodium chloride. Sodium chloride gives a white precipitate of silver chloride with silver nitrate solution. The precipitate is soluble in ammonium hydroxide.</br>
Na + Cl → NaCl </br>
NaCl + AgNO<sub>3</sub> → AgCl + NaNO<sub>3</sub> </br>
AgCl + 2NH<sub>4</sub>OH → [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]Cl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O </br>
**(b) Bromine**
Sodium bromide formed during the preparation of Lassaigne's extract reacts with silver nitrate to form pale yellow precipitate of silver bromide, which is sparingly soluble in ammonium hydroxide.</br>
Na + Br → NaBr
NaBr + AgNO<sub>3</sub> → AgBr + NaNO<sub>3</sub> </br>
**(c) Iodine**
Sodium iodide formed during the preparation of sodium fusion extract reacts with silver nitrate solution to form yellow precipitate of silver iodide, which is insoluble in ammonium hydroxide. </br>
Na + I → NaI </br>
NaI + AgNO<sub>3</sub> → AgI + NaNO<sub>3</sub>
