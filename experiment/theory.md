Nitrogen, sulphur, and halogens present in organic compounds are detected by Lassaigne’s test. Here, a small piece of Na metal is heated in a fusion tube with the organic compound. The principle is that, in doing so, Na converts all the elements present into ionic form.</br>
Na + C + N → NaCN</br>
2Na + S → Na<sub>2</sub>S</br>
Na + X → NaX ( X= Cl, Br, or I)</br>
The formed ionic salts are extracted from the fused mass by boiling it with distilled water. This is called sodium fusion extract.</br></br>
**(I) Test for Nitrogen**</br>
The extract is boiled with FeSO4 and acidified with concentrated H2SO4. The appearance of Prussian blue colour indicates the presence of nitrogen.
The following reactions occur:</br>
1.  Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 6CN<sup>-</sup> → Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>4-</sup></br>
2. Fe<sup>2+</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> → Fe<sup>3+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup></br>
3. Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>4-</sup> + 4Fe<sup>3+</sup> → Fe<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O</br></br>

The acid helps in the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions. The formation of ferriferous cyanide indicates the presence of nitrogen.</br></br>
*Note*:</br> (i) This test is not given by compounds containing N but not C atoms. For example, NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> does not answer this test despite having an N atom. This is because both C and N are required to form CN– ion.</br>
(ii)This test is not given by diazonium salts as they decompose to give nitrogen gas on heating.</br></br>
**(II) Test for Sulphur**</br>
The extract is treated with Lead Acetate. The appearance of black precipitate of lead sulphide which confirms the presence of sulphur atom in the compound.

The following reaction occurs:</br>
 S<sup>2-</sup> + Pb<sup>2+</sup> → PbS </br></br>
**(III)Test for Halogens**</br>
The extract is acidified with HNO3 and then treated with AgNO3. A white precipitate soluble in NH4OH indicates the presence of Cl, a yellowish precipitate sparingly soluble in NH4OH indicates the presence of Br, and a yellow precipitate insoluble in NH4OH indicates the presence of I.</br>
AgNO<sub>3</sub> + NaX → AgX ↓ + NaNO<sub>3</sub>
